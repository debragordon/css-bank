## Description
We were tasked to build a basic banking form and utilize the basic input types - text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, email ... to name a few. This is a showcase of element implementation and basic CSS styling.  Note: this form is not connected to Javascript and is not a functioning form.

## How to Run
1. Clone repo to your local computer
2. In your terminal be sure you are in this downloaded directory
3. Once you are in the correct directory run this:

  ```
  http-server -p 9999
  ```

4. Then navigate to http://localhost:9999 in your browser to view the basic form (preferably open in Google Chrome)

> TIP: To view source code, open the Chrome dev tools and click "Source"
